Welcome to the [Tour Operator Search extension](https://tour-operator.lsdev.biz/extensions/search/).

If you haven't yet had the chance to [install and configure the Tour Operator Plugin](https://tour-operator.lsdev.biz), you should do that before proceeding here! 

So here's a little info on the Tour Operator Search Extension; it adds robust search functionality to your Tour Operator website by enhancing Search capabilities. 

Our favourite part, the Search extension is integrated with FacetWP. So if you are looking to display filters on your search results, this is the plugin for you. 

Remember that in order to use this, the FacetWP plugin installed. The [Tour Operator plugin](https://tour-operator.lsdev.biz/) adds settings to enable or disable facets/filters on archive pages.
